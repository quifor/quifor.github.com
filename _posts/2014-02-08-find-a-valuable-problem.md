Find a problem, determine if it is a valuable enough problem, determine if it is a problem that is feasible to solve, and then solve that problem.

Anyone can pick a new problem from the infinite queue and turn that into a product. Developers write  utilities for themselves all the time to make life easier, or to prove a point, or to test out a cool technology.  But those are not products, or at least not products that have a reasonable chance of turning into a business. 

To form a business the only path is to choose a valuable problem that can be developed into a real product that real customers pay real money for.  This requires understanding the who the customers are,  understanding the size and urgency of the problem, and discovering what the customers will pay for the solution. 

To be sure, there are plenty of other factors that will need to be considered before the the idea turns into a business. See the [Business Model Canvas][businessmodelgeneration], for one quick-start view of the minimal subset of concerns. The core, however, is understanding customer need and having a feasible and profitable means of filling that need. 

Without an understanding of the market potential, any app built is great for developing technical skills or for showing off  technical prowess, but it won't make money except accidentally. The Apple AppStore is a graveyard of such apps. The recent talk from Infinity Softworks CEO [Elia Freedman][eliainsider] at Urban Airship addressed exactly that point. Elia stated that the old model of software, version releases every so often that people will pay for, is gone. Forever. Even Adobe, a traditional bastion if ever there was one, has shifted to a SaaS model. And the other major players now give away their software for free. How can a small company compete with free? 

With an understanding of the market potential, with a deeper understanding of the problem the customer faces, with a  better solution (not just a little better, much better), with better service, design, usability, or domain focus. Price is only one purchase motivator. It is the challenge of software businesses to add that additional value, beyond the raw functionality of the software. Should be fun.
