I have had several discussions recently concerning the origins of products. How should products be built? Out of all the possible ideas, cool tech, interesting sidelines, crazy ideas, blue-sky dreams, what technology should be chosen to align the company? What should the devs be spending their time on?  How can we choose what product to build? 

It is important to step back and ask what the purpose is of building the technology. The are many possible reasons for a company to develop a technology, and gaining an immediate return, while a possibility, is not the only reason. Technology development can be used to drive adoption of other products, create thought-leadership in a field, attract developers to a company, pure research,  brand recognition, establish dependencies, create a software ecosystem, build esprits d'corp, create a social benefit, improve the environment, and of course, make a profit. 

However, if the purpose of developing the technology is to drive revenue, if the purpose is to build a business and not just an application, then the questions becomes much simpler.

To begin with,  don't build a product (or technology) at all; create a solution and then use technology to make that solution cheap and scaleable. 

What is a business, after all? A business is created when an individual has a need that they cannot fill on their own. If the need is sufficiently dire that they are willing to pay money for it, then a business potential has been created. If either they are willing to pay enough, or there are enough people willing to pay, then a business opportunity is created. Actually filling that need is the process of creating  a business. 

Notice that there is nothing in that definition of a business that involves technology. Technology does not solve problems: technology makes solving problems cheaper and easier to scale. This applies to software as well, of course. A belief that the technology is the solution is often why developers fail at creating businesses. They focus too much on the cool technology they are creating and not enough on the cold reality of the customer's needs.  The solution is simply what meets a customer's need, and technology simply (or complexly) makes selling, sharing, spreading, and scaling that solution cheaper and faster. 

Don't build technology when what you should be building is a business.
