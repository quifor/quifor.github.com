Harold Pashler is a leading light in attention and memory research. He is well-known for his models of working memory (another post) as well as his task-switching research. In the past few years he has turned his attention to education and learning. The burning question is, what has the past decades of psychological research into the substrates of attention and memory revealed to be of practical use? What is the new evidence to support or disconfirm our current educational methods? What is the science of it?  A 2010 paper entitled, "Recent Research on Human Learning Challenges Conventional Instructional Strategies" summarizes the current state of the field (from the cognitive science side of education) and takes a hard look at current educational practice. 

The paper can be reduced to three learning modes that are most effective for long-term learning. This is not to say that other modes (rote learning, re-reading etc.) are not effective to some degree, but that these modes are the most effective for long-term learning. These three modes are: 

1. Spaced Repetition
2. Testing
3. Interleaving


Spaced repetition is simply distributing study periods on a topic over time, with non-study periods (the study-gap) in between. 
In one experiment, subjects had two study-periods, varying by study-gap duration, followed, again at various intervals, by a test. The outcome variable, test scores, is therefore a function of study-gap and test-delay. 
The experiment showed that test scores increase as you decrease test delay, which makes intuitive sense: we remember recently learned material better. But test scores are also non-monotonically dependent on the study-gap, such that a gap of 5%~10% of the test delay is optimal. 
The take-home is that if you want to remember material for a long period of time, the intervals between studying that material should be long as well. That is, material should be relearned at least a year after the first exposure. This is something that happens rarely in modern education. 

Testing is the second easy means to enhance learning. Most people think of testing as assessment and have bad memories of test scores in school. However, the  utility is test is probably greater in learning rather then simply in assessing what was learned. 
The simple insight here is that the effort of recalling information improves the ability to later recall the information. Anyone who has self-tested with a stack of index cards has experienced this: the easy ones should be discarded, and only the harder ones tested. Eventually, all the cards are learned. The corollary here is that the most learning occurs when you get the item wrong. This is naturally frustrating, and tends to cause people to believe that testing is not benefiting them, when in fact it is far more useful than simply re-reading the material. 

The third means of enhancing learning is using the interleaving technique. That is, items to be learned are not learned in a block, but shuffled in with other items to be learned. A mathematics text book, for example, should not give a single large block of test questions dealing with the material at the end of the chapter, but rather the shuffle in perhaps 10% new material in with 90% of old material. This has the benefit of using both interleaving and spaced repetition at the same time. 


So, if these measures are so great, why aren't they used? According to the paper, simply implementing these measures  can boost final test scores by two or three fold. It turns out that the culprit is human's lack of skill in metacognition. That is, our ability to introspect as to the motivations or functioning of our internal thought processes. For example, it is counter-intuitive that missing test questions is actually improving your final test scores. The subjective experience is one of failing. On the other hand, there is a constant sense of understanding while re-reading material, or  at least no obvious sensation of failure. So if you were to base you judgement of training accuracy on the introspection, re-reading is the clear winner. But that would be like a weight lifter getting better by lifting progressively lighter weights and until until they are tired. The only way to make real gains is to at least occasionally, push their muscles to failure and constantly increase the difficulty of their training. The same is true of mental training or learning.
