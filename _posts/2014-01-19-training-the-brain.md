## Plasticity ##

The brain is plastic. Not actually plastic, unless you have a [makerbot and an MRI of your brain][makezine], but malleable, moldable, and capable of change. Sometime radical change. The everyday examples of this are simple skill learning. It takes only a few [thousand hours of deliberate practice][hbr] to become a world-class expert, for example. Compare this to the time it takes for less plastic organisms, say a hamster. World-class at running in a cage, perhaps. Or a rock. 

Learning, simple memory, are examples of plastic brains. More unusual examples are when entire functions that usually are processed in one area of the brain are instead processed in another. This typically occurs after traumatic injury where the area of the brain is destroyed and those functions are picked up by another area. This is another extreme case. 

Somewhere in-between is where the proponents of brain training, or the more recent attempts at neuro-enhancement, fall. Participants typically practice some simple on-line games that purport to exercise some neural functioning. The participants improve on the task over time, and feel that their time is well-spent. 

Improving on a task that you are practicing is not unusual, of course. It would be surprising if you didn't. The first real question is whether the practice on the online task *transfers* to actual gains on other, non-practiced tasks or gains in general cognitive functioning. This is called a *"transfer effect"* and is the holy grail of brain training.  And just as elusive. The second question is, even if transfer effects are seen, are any gains greater than either a placebo task or some other task, such as learning to play a musical instrument or doing cross-word puzzles. 

Clearly, if the brain-training task is no better than placebo (some tasks that is not designed to brain-train, but is not just staring at a blank wall), nor better than other, arguably more worth-while activities, then actually paying money to companies to "train your brain" is absurd. Read a book or go for a walk. 

Unfortunately for the hard-working marketing teams at Luminosity, the available evidence in [older adults][plosone], [the elderly][bt-older], from  a [meta-analysis][ncbi], or a more [recent meta-analysis][bt-review] show that in fact no significant transfer effects are found. This may be bad news for companies trying to make a buck, but good news for people looking for real self-improvement. Stop wasting money and time on online placebo training and [learn an instrument][skill-music], a new language, or [just get some excercise][skill-review]. All activities which have, in fact, showed real transfer effects. Learning, in and of itself, alters your plastic brain.
